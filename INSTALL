                     SETUP: How to install Dumper ?

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In order to use Dumper you have to put it on your (development) server, and
include it in your script. You can put it somewhere in the INCLUDE_PATH, or
specify the full path to the "class.dumper.php" file.

You have to modify the "dumper.ini" file too. It is the configuration file for
Dumper. The first option is choosing a skin:

 [skin]
 selected = "orange"

The value for this setting has to be the name of one of the sub-folders from the
"Dumper/skins/" folder. If the value provided for the skin results in not finding
the skin, the `default` skin will be used instead.

The second option is used to set the correct web path to the folder where Dumper
is installed. This is used in order to make the images from Dumper's CSS skins
web-accessible.

 [css]
 url = "http://www.example.com/Dumper/"

So far those two are the only configuration options.

All the CSS files ("skin.css") from the "Dumper/skins/" sub-folders must have the
proper permissions in order to be readable from Dumper. Same applies for
"dumper.ini" and "dumper.js" files.
